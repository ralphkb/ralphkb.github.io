## Introduction
As a new Full Stack Developer, I am constantly learning and improving my skills. This repository contains the first and early version of my portfolio that I built when I started learning. While this version may be basic, it served as a starting point for showcasing my skills and potential capabilities.  
I have plans to recode and enhance this portfolio using frameworks and advanced techniques soon.

## Features
- Simple and clean design.
- Divided into multiple sections.
- Dark mode is available for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions.
- Responsive layout for a seamless viewing experience on various devices.
